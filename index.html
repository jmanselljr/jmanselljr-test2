<h1>Why i don't like DC</h1>
<h3>It not that i hate DC it's that i don't really care for it, although
  there is some things that really annoy me about it. Some of the main reasons
  i have so much hate for DC is because it is extremely dark, when they
  try to be funny in the movies the jokes are horrible and you got to be
  kidding me they are making a fricking aquaman movie, the Teen Titans go movie
  is going to be better then that. The real reason is really just the fact that
  i like Marvel better along with 99% percent of the world and i'd rather watch
  any Marvel movie 1000 times before i watch the aquaman movie. I actually
  really like DC just have alot of hate for it because they are making the
  aquaman movie and the Teen Titans Go movie.<h3>
